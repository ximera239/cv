## Overview

During my life I read quite some professional books and papers. I will not be able to recall even the names for the most of them.
During my carrier I solved some number of challenging problems, and when you are asked about that it can be hard to recall.
Here I want to keep some links to books that I read (with some implementations), I will leave here some examples of problems which were difficult and important to solve at the time I got them, or problems which I found interesting, maybe tricky or taught me something

### Books 

- A wonderful book by Thomas H. Cormen (and others) ["Introduction to Algorithms"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/026204630X/)

For the first time I read this book in Uni, and then re-read some parts later

Some examples: 

1. [Sorting](https://github.com/ximera239/cv/blob/main/modules/cormen/src/main/scala/com/zhoga/cv/cormen/Sorting.scala)

### Interesting problems

- Stack numeric and non-numeric

Sometimes I checked [questions](https://ru.stackoverflow.com/q/1278314/417043) on stackoverflow, once I found a question, which I suppose was asked by a student about homework, but problem itself seemed interesting to me. Original question was in Russian.

> Implement immutable Stack structure using scala List, it should have `average` method in case if parameter type is numeric, and it should return average in constant time
